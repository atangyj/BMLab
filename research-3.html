        <p>The decisions we make have tremendous consequences on our own lives, the lives of others around us, and subsequently on society as a whole. It can also be said that “We are our decisions”. Thus, at the heart of understanding the human brain and
          mind is to study how our neural connections give rise to the decisions we observe in people’s behaviors. Moreover, an important question for our lab is whether these decision processes change with age. Whereas some studies suggest that older
          adults tend to be more conservative than younger adults in their decisions and take less risks, some other studies find that older adults are in fact more risk-seeking than younger adults. This is a nascent area of research, and we hope to make
          contributions to the field by conducting studies utilizing psychological testing and neuroimaging methodologies.</p>
