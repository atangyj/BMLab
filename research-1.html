        <p>Everyone ages. Aging is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease, a debilitating condition associated with neurodegeneration and severe declines in cognitive processes such as memory and executive function, that affects 1 out of 8 persons
          (based on U.S. samples). Even older adults who are free from cognitive impairment still experience and show signs of cognitive decline that can have consequences on the daily functioning and freedom of the person as well as their caregivers.
          There is thus an urgent, important need to understand the nature of neurocognitive changes associated with aging in effort to prevent, ameliorate, or even reverse the detrimental effects of the aging brain and enhance the beneficial changes.</p>

        <p>Some of our key findings show that the older adult brain have reduced neural selectivity of responses and so are less sensitive to subtle differences in external stimuli (see figure below adapted from Goh et al. (2010), NeuroImage, 51(1), 336-344).
          Another age-related pattern of neural engagement is that older adult frontal cortices tend to show higher levels of activity even when processing easy tasks, perhaps reflecting a greater effort required with age to perform even simple computations.</p>
        <p>Critical recent work in this field has revealed that not everyone’s shows neurocognitive decline with aging, and not everyone declines in the same way either. These are hints that there are certain factors that mitigate the effects of biological
          aging on the brain and mind. In the figure below, the left panel shows that there are different patterns of longitudinal performance across individuals (and between cognitively normal (CN) and impaired (CI) groups) and across different cognitive
          abilities as they age (adapted from Goh et al. (2012), Psychol. Aging, 27(3), 707-719). The right panel shows that individuals with preserved cognition have less heightened longitudinal frontal brain responses (adapted from Goh et al. (2013),
          NeuroImage, 69, 43-50).</p>
