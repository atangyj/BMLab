    <div class="research-title">How does the brain work? What is the mind?</div>
    <div class="research-desc">These are The Big Questions that boggle our laboratory everyday. The BML began in August 2012 on a voyage to discover the answers to these questions. We hope and believe that not only will such understanding potentially help in the development of
      interventions to treat brain-based and related disease, it will also be important for improving human life. Not to mention, we think its cool.

        <p>Everyone ages. Aging is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease, a debilitating condition associated with neurodegeneration and severe declines in cognitive processes such as memory and executive function, that affects 1 out of 8 persons
          (based on U.S. samples). Even older adults who are free from cognitive impairment still experience and show signs of cognitive decline that can have consequences on the daily functioning and freedom of the person as well as their caregivers.
          There is thus an urgent, important need to understand the nature of neurocognitive changes associated with aging in effort to prevent, ameliorate, or even reverse the detrimental effects of the aging brain and enhance the beneficial changes.</p>
        <div class="image-cna-1-face"></div>
        <div class="image-cna-1-brain"></div>
        <p>Some of our key findings show that the older adult brain have reduced neural selectivity of responses and so are less sensitive to subtle differences in external stimuli (see figure below adapted from Goh et al. (2010), NeuroImage, 51(1), 336-344).
          Another age-related pattern of neural engagement is that older adult frontal cortices tend to show higher levels of activity even when processing easy tasks, perhaps reflecting a greater effort required with age to perform even simple computations.</p>
        <p>Critical recent work in this field has revealed that not everyone’s shows neurocognitive decline with aging, and not everyone declines in the same way either. These are hints that there are certain factors that mitigate the effects of biological
          aging on the brain and mind. In the figure below, the left panel shows that there are different patterns of longitudinal performance across individuals (and between cognitively normal (CN) and impaired (CI) groups) and across different cognitive
          abilities as they age (adapted from Goh et al. (2012), Psychol. Aging, 27(3), 707-719). The right panel shows that individuals with preserved cognition have less heightened longitudinal frontal brain responses (adapted from Goh et al. (2013),
          NeuroImage, 69, 43-50).</p>

        <p>Each and everyone of us experiences different sorts of environmental and social interactions. Some of these differences in external experiences are based on the different culture groups that we each belong to. Evidence suggests that there are
          culture-related differences in cognitive processing styles across individuals from different people groups. For example, it has been shown that Westerners engage more analytic processing styles involving greater attention to object features
          whereas East Asians engage more holistic processing styles involving greater attention to contextual information.</p>
        <p>The implication of these findings is that neurocognitive trajectories over the lifespan are not immutable, but are malleable to external experiences. As such, the interaction between culture-based influences and biological-based factors are important
          considerations for understanding how the brain works and for developing interventions that are beneficial for human cognition.</p>
        <p>The figure below shows that young adult Westerners and East Asians have comparable brain responses when processing visual stimuli consisting of objects and background scenes (adapted from Goh et al. (2007), Cogn. Affect. Behav. Neurosci., 7(1),
          44-52). By contrast, older adult Westerners show object and scene processing responses, but older East Asians show scene processing responses with significantly reduced object processing regions engaged. These findings suggest that culture-related
          bias for contextual processing may have accentuated background scene attention at the expense of object attention in older East Asians. This could possibly be due to age-related reduction in attentional resources for complete processing of the
          both aspects of the visual stimuli.</p>
        <div class="image-ccn-1"></div>

        <p>In further support of culture-related effects on the brain, the figure below illustrates that, in younger adults, East Asians have thicker inferior temporal regions compared to Westerners (in blue) whereas Westerners have thicker frontal cortices
          than East Asians (in red) (adapted from Chee et al. (2011), J. Cogn. Neurosci., 23(5), 1065-1079). These culture-related differences in cortical thickness appear to be maintained in their older counterparts. Critically, this was only true for
          high-performing older adults. Culture-related differences were not observed for low-performing older adults. These findings suggest that experiential culture-related effects on brain structure were maintained in high-performing older adults
          but biological influences may have been more overwhelming for the low-performing individuals.</p>
        <div class="image-ccn-2"></div>
        <p>Further work is necessary to determine the sources of these culture-related effects, the extent of their influence, and to identify key aspects of the different cognitive styles that may have bearing on age-related changes in brain structure and
          function.

        <p>The decisions we make have tremendous consequences on our own lives, the lives of others around us, and subsequently on society as a whole. It can also be said that “We are our decisions”. Thus, at the heart of understanding the human brain and
          mind is to study how our neural connections give rise to the decisions we observe in people’s behaviors. Moreover, an important question for our lab is whether these decision processes change with age. Whereas some studies suggest that older
          adults tend to be more conservative than younger adults in their decisions and take less risks, some other studies find that older adults are in fact more risk-seeking than younger adults. This is a nascent area of research, and we hope to make
          contributions to the field by conducting studies utilizing psychological testing and neuroimaging methodologies.</p>
